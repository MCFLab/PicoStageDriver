## Various parts/supplies

For the assembly of the motor and remote controller, various small
electronics components and supplies are required, but these likely found
in any well-stocked electronics bench:

- Board spacers

- A selection of screws

- Wire of various gauges and colors

- Heat shrink tubing

- Small male and female headers

- LEDs

- Power supply: We used a spare laptop power supply, but this can
  readily be found at any electronics retailer for about \$10, depending
  on the voltage and current rating.

- Connector cable: We used a spare ethernet cord to connect the remote
  to the motor controller.

Because of the varied mounting holes for the joystick, rotary dial
encoders, and display, we decided to design and 3d-printed a custom
enclosure to house the components for the remote controller. We also
printed custom knobs for the rotary dial encoders.
