# Software

We provide the required software to be loaded onto the Motor Controller Pico and, if used, the remote controller Pico. The attached stages can be controlled either through the remote controller (if used) or via serial commands over USB (see the [detailed list of commands](CommandList.md)).

We also offer a driver package to interface with the Pico Stage Driver both in C and in Python, as well as simple graphical user interfaces utilizing these drivers. In addition, we implemented a rudimentary version of a driver for the popular microscopy control software [µManager](https://micro-manager.org/).

We provide basic [installation instructions](SoftwareInstallation.md) for all of the software provided.
